        One of my most cherished accomplishments. I worked my ass off to get

      </Step>
      <Step title="Family Roadtrip 🚗">
        To celebrate graduating, my family and I did a road trip down the

      <Step title="Full-Time at Workiva">
        I was offered and accepted a full-time offer with Workiva, as well as
        the opportunity to continue my internship until graduation.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Moved to Des Moines 🏙">
        I moved Downtown DSM into a quaint 1BR apartment. Des Moines has always

        This internship meant a lot to me. Being able to work part-time while
        still getting my school work done was huge.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Started Tutoring Programming">
        Why not make a little extra money and sharpen my skills? I taught Python
        to ISU Freshman.

      <Step title="Started at Iowa State University 🌪❤️">
        I've been a die-hard Cyclone fan my whole life. It was a no-brainer that
        I was going to ISU, especially since they have a great Engineering
        program.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Learned How To Program">
        CS 101. Our professor asked a simple question - "Who here has prior
        programming experience?". About 80% of the class raised their hands. I
        knew it was going to be an uphill battle from here.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Wanted To Dropout of College">
        I didn't pick up programming right away. It didn't help we learned C to
        start – I'm glad I stuck with it, though.
